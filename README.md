# Microsoft Focus Center

This project contains community solutions and tools available for fusion teams to use in order to help accelerate solution lifecycle management in Microsoft Power Platform. Although the underlying features and components used to build these are fully supported, the solutions and tools included are sample implementations.  

If you encounter issues using the solutions and tools, please report issues. We will provide updates including bug fixes regularly and encourage community PRs for issues and enhancements as well. 

Our customers and community can use and customize these to implement in their organizations by forking the repository; however, please note that we are unable to provide support and bug fixes to forked repositories.

Important:
Microsoft Support will not be able to help with issues related to these solutions and tools. For issues with core features in Microsoft Power Platform, use standard channel to contact Microsoft Support.
